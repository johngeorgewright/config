# @targetd

A speedy, highly extensible, typed, in-memory data store built in Node.js & Typescript.

It's perfect for storing any shape of data that can be "targeted" with key/values.

## When to use @targetd

- Configuration
- Small blogs/websites

## When _not_ to use @targetd

- With big data
- For tokenising/searching data

## How it works

All data is stored in a list of "rules". Each rule contains a "name", "payload" and an optional "targeting" property that can be "queried".

All payloads, targeting & queries are typed & validated at runtime & compile time.

An example rule:

```json
{
  "name": "blog",
  "payload": {
    "title": "A news thing",
    "body": "Here's the body"
  },
  "targeting": {
    "category": ["news", "weather"]
  }
}
```

The above example shows a payload which will **only** be found when a query will match it's targeting structure.

**BEFORE GOING FURTHER** please note that the `Data` class is entirely immutable meaning that you must use the returned value of every function. For exampe:

```typescript
import { Data } from '@targetd/api'

// THE BELOW IS INCORRECT!!! the data object has not had any targeting or rules added
const data = Data.create()
data.useTargeting(...)
data.addRules(...)

// âœ… This is better.
const data = Data.create()
  .useTargeting(...)
  .addRules(...)

// ... or you can do this
let data = Data.create()
data = data.useTargeting(...)
data = data.addRules(...)
```

### Typing Data (payloads)

All typing and validation is done using the awesome [zod][] project and is exported from the `@targetd/api` package. [Zod][zod] is an easy project to understand and you'll need to know some of the basics.

```typescript
import { Data } from '@targetd/api'
import z from 'zod'

let data = Data.create().useDataValidator(
  'blog',
  z.strictObject({
    title: z.string(),
    body: z.string(),
  })
)
```

Now I can safely add some rules. Without the above, however, you'll receive an error that you cannot add to the 'blog' data type.

```typescript
data = data.addRules([
  {
    name: 'blog',
    payload: {
      title: 'A news thing',
      body: "Here's the body",
    },
  },
])
```

### Typing Targeting

As mentioned above, all typing and validation is done using the [zod][] project.

```typescript
import { Data } from '@targetd/api'
import z from 'zod'

let data = Data.create().useTargeting('category', {
  predicate: (q) => (t) => t.includes(q),
  queryValidator: z.string(),
  targetingValidator: z.array(z.literal('news').or(z.literal('weather'))),
})
```

Now one can safely target by `category` without receiving an error.

```typescript
data = data.addRules([
  {
    name: 'blog',
    payload: {
      title: 'A news thing',
      body: "Here's the body",
    },
    targeting: {
      category: ['news', 'weather'],
    },
  },
])
```

### Querying Data

```typescript
console.info(
  data.getPayload('blog', { category: 'news' })
  // This will find the **first** rule that matches the query
)
// { title: 'A new thing', body: "Here's the body" }
```
